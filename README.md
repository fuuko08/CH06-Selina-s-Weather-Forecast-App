# Weather-Forecast-App

## Description

I created an web app to track 5 days weather forecast. When users enter a city name, the app presents with that city's today and next 5 days weather forecast with temparature, humidity, windspeed, and a tiny icon of the weather condition. Users can also save the searched history, and click on it to reload the searched cities for later use

## User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
